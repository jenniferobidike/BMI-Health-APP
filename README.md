## BMI Health App Built using React Hooks

  I built a BMI App that calculates a person's body mass index (BMI) and outputs the result. The app is bhult using React hooks, HTML, and CSS. 
  It is fully resonsive on all device sizes and is designed beautifully. Check out the app on (https://bmi-health-react-app.netlify.app/)
