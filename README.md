## BMI Health App Built using React Hooks

  I built a BMI App that calculates a person's body mass index (BMI) and outputs the result. The app is built using React hooks, HTML, and CSS. 
  It is fully resonsive on all devices and is beautifully designed. Check out the app on [BMI Health App](https://bmi-health-react-app.netlify.app/)
